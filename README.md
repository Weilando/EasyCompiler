# EasyCompiler
This project is a compiler for _Easy_, a simple programming language.
Its description can be found [here](/docs/EasyLanguage.md).
The compiler's output is Jasmin Assembler, which can be assembled into Java Bytecode, i.e. the programs can be executed on the JVM.

One can track the project's progress in the [roadmap](/docs/Roadmap.md).

## Build and Run
Gradle is used for dependency-management, building and testing the compiler.
